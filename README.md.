# AirlineCheckin&BoardingSystem

## 📌 Description of the Application

AirlineCheckin&BoardingSystem is a school project that simulates the main operations of an airport check-in and boarding process using classic data structures. 
Each part of the airport flow is connected to a specific structure to show how real systems stay organized, fast, and predictable.
The goal of this project is to teach how data structures work in a practical and realistic way instead of using abstract numbers. 
The program also reflects how real airline software handles passengers, baggage, search operations, boarding priority, and seat changes.

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

### **If using command line (javac + java):**
1. Open the project folder in your terminal.
2. Compile all `.java` files:

### **If using an IDE (NetBeans, IntelliJ, VS Code):**
1. Open the project folder in your IDE.  
2. Make sure the JDK is installed.  
3. Click **Run** on "MainSystem.java". 

## 🗂️ Files Demonstrating Each Required Data Structure

| Data Structure | Purpose in the System | File Demonstrating It |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Array** | Stores newly added passengers | `PassengerArray.java` |
| **Queue** | Maintains check-in order (first come, first served) | `CheckInQueue.java` |
| **Priority Queue** | Handles boarding priority order | `BoardingPriorityQueue.java` |
| **Binary Search Tree (BST)** | Fast search for passengers using PNR | `PassengerBST.java` |
| **Singly Linked List (SLL)** | Baggage logging | `BaggageSLL.java` |
| **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** | Gate activity timeline | `GateDLL.java` |
| **Stacks** | Undo/redo for seat assignments | `SeatStack.java` |
| **Sorting Algorithms** | Bubble, Insertion, Selection sorting of passengers | `SortingAlgorithms.java` |
| **Main Program** | Connects all modules and runs the simulation | `MainSystem.java` |
